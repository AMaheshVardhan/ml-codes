# Number Series Predictor Using Machine Learning

This Python script demonstrates a basic example of using machine learning to predict values in a number series. In this case, it predicts Fahrenheit temperatures based on Celsius temperatures using a linear regression model.

## Requirements
- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the script.

2. Run the script using a Python environment with the required libraries installed.

3. Enter a Celsius temperature when prompted, and the script will predict the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature.

## Code Explanation
- The script uses TensorFlow and NumPy to create, train, and use a simple linear regression model.
- The model is trained with provided Celsius and Fahrenheit data.
- It makes predictions based on user input.

Feel free to modify and extend this script for your own number series prediction tasks!
